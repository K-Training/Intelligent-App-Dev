# Intelligent Mobile Development!

## My Project Idea and Plan:
### Project Name: A Communication App for University Students
The application will enable students from the University of Management And Technology to communicate with each other on a single platform. This application will give STUDENTS the facility to chat, and share important notice. There will be a LOGIN PAGE for the users and CODE to join the same group.

I will be using HP Laptop, Android Studio, Java, and XML for the development of this application.

This app is specifically targeting a group of people and not anyone to one chat. The users would be provided with a login/signup page. Once they register on the app, they’ll be ready to enter the chat room with a code. After they enter the chat room, they can communicate and share the data.

The user should be able to download the app either from Baidu, App Gallery, Play store or Apple store.
 The app should be able to forecast weather; cloudy, sunny, windy, hazy, foggy and or
rainy.
 The app should be able to record the number of steps covered by the user per day and
record it in a database.
 The app should allow users to receive weather forecast data and get notifications of
weather updates
 The app should have running and walking functions which will calculate the distance
covered and also calories burnt by the user.
 The app should be able to record data for current, hourly, daily, and up to 7 days weather
forecast.
 The app should record statistical analysis such as graphs and show weekly trends of users.
 Large number of users should able to use the app concurrently.
 Users should be able to add coordinates (Geo Position) or search location.
 The app should have an alert function to notify users who have run for 4 continuous days and then recommend that the user should not run.
 The proposed app should show notifications on weather update on selected locations
 The proposed app should offer data on the location saved by the user, in ranges of:
  o Current
  o Hourly
  o Up to seven days
 The app should notify the users on severe weather conditions.
 The app should allow users to add or remove locations to get weather data.
 The app should have a social function that will enable the user to login and connect with friends using the same app.
 Users should be able to send friend request to other users using the app
 Friends should see each other, example User A and User B are friends and can see each other but User A is not friend with User C, so User A can’t see User C.

 Friends can invite each other to go running together and Send the location through the app.
 Friends will also be able to see each other’s statistics.
