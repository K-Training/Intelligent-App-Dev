# Intelligent Mobile Development!

## My Project Idea and Plan:
### Project Name: College Students Communication App
This application will enable college students to communicate with each other on a single platform. It will give them the facility to chat, and share important notice through it. There will be a login page for the users and a code to join the same group.

The development of this application can be done using Android Studio, Java, and XML.

This app is specifically targeting a group of people and not anyone to one chat. The users would be provided with a login/signup page. Once they register on the app, theyâ€™ll be ready to enter the chat room with a code. After they enter the chat room, they can communicate and share the data.
