# Intelligent Mobile Development!

## My Project Idea and Plan:
### Project Name: A Communication App for University Students Project
The application will enable students from the University of Management And Technology to communicate with each other on a single platform. This application will give STUDENTS the facility to chat, and share important notice. There will be a LOGIN PAGE for the users and CODE to join the same group.

I will be using HP Laptop, Android Studio, Java, and XML for the development of this application. This app specifically targets a group of students and not one to one chat. The users would be provided with a login/signup page. Once they register on the app, theyâ€™ll be ready to enter the chat room with a code. After they enter the chat room, they can communicate and share the data.

The user should be able to download the app either from Baidu, App Gallery, Play store or Apple store. Large number of users should able to use the app concurrently. The app should have a social function that will enable the user to login and connect with friends using the same app. Users should be able to send friend request to other users using the app. Friends should see each other, example User A and User B are friends and can see each other.
